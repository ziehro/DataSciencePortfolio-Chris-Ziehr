# Lottery Results Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project explores patterns and correlations in lottery results over three years, examining factors such as moon phases, weather conditions, and seasonal variations. The aim is to uncover any unexpected trends that could influence the outcomes of lottery draws and provide insights into whether certain external factors have statistical significance.

## Data Source

The dataset includes lottery draw results, dates, and associated moon phases and weather conditions at the time of each draw. Data was aggregated from [source name], with additional meteorological information obtained from [weather data source] and lunar cycle information from [moon phase source].

*Note: Mention any data usage restrictions or necessary acknowledgements here.*

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

## Key Findings

- Summarize the main outcomes of your analysis. For instance, "The study indicated no significant correlation between moon phases and lottery outcomes, while some minor correlations were observed between extreme weather conditions and certain draw results."
- Discuss any patterns, anomalies, or insights discovered during the analysis, providing a critical evaluation of the results.

## How to Run the Project

Outline the steps needed to reproduce your analysis:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `LotteryResultsAnalysis` folder.
2. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the analysis scripts or Jupyter notebooks: `jupyter notebook lottery_analysis.ipynb` or `python lottery_analysis.py`.

## Visualizations

Describe the visual elements created as part of your analysis:

- Line graphs showing lottery result trends over time against lunar phases.
- Scatter plots examining the relationship between weather conditions and lottery outcomes.
- Statistical charts that illustrate findings and support your conclusions.

*Link to any interactive visualizations or include images directly in the README if relevant.*
