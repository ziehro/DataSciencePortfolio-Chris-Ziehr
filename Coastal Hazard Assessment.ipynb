    "# Coastal Hazard Assessment Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project aims to conduct a comprehensive coastal hazard assessment focusing on identifying areas vulnerable to erosion, storm surges, and sea-level rise. Our goal is to develop actionable insights and recommendations to enhance coastal resilience and mitigate risks facing coastal communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Analyze coastal features including bluff height, sediment composition, and vegetation cover.\n",
    "- Model erosion risks and storm surge scenarios to identify high-risk areas.\n",
    "- Assess the vulnerability of coastal communities and ecosystems.\n",
    "- Communicate risks and engage with stakeholders to inform policy and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "We will employ Geographic Information Systems (GIS), numerical models, and vulnerability indices to conduct our analysis. This notebook will document the data analysis processes, findings, and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this project, we aim to provide a detailed assessment report that highlights vulnerable areas, predicts future risks, and suggests mitigation strategies to protect coastal assets and communities.\n",
