    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook documents the process of collecting and analyzing coastal environmental data using a custom Android application. The data is aimed at assessing coastal hazards and includes observations of various sea and plant life as well as beach composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The data was collected using a bespoke Android application designed for this purpose. Users can submit observations of different environmental variables such as types of sea life, beach composition, and other relevant metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Android App Screenshot](INSERT_IMAGE_LINK_HERE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "The application allows users to input data while on-site at various beach locations. This data includes geographical coordinates, environmental conditions, and other pertinent observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "The collected data is stored in Google Firestore and periodically exported to CSV format for analysis. This section will discuss the process of transforming raw data from Firestore into a structured format suitable for analysis.\n",
