# Beach Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze various characteristics of 250 North American beaches, focusing on aspects such as sand quantity, rock distribution, and environmental factors. The goal is to identify patterns and insights that can help in understanding beach composition and its potential impact on tourist attraction and environmental conservation.

## Data Source

The dataset for this analysis was collected via a Java-based Android application and consists of metrics like latitude, longitude, sand, pebbles, rocks, and environmental quality indicators. 

*Note: If there are any restrictions or licenses associated with the dataset, mention them here.*

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Folium

## Key Findings

- Briefly summarize the key findings of your analysis. For example, "The analysis revealed a higher concentration of sandy beaches in the eastern coast compared to the rocky beaches predominant in the western regions."
- Highlight any surprising patterns or insights related to environmental factors or beach popularity.

## How to Run the Project

Provide instructions on how to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `BeachDataAnalysis` folder.
2. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts: `jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb` or `python analysis.py`.

## Visualizations

Include a brief description of the visualizations included in the project:

- Heatmaps displaying the geographical distribution of beach types.
- Bar charts comparing the average amounts of sand, pebbles, and rocks across regions.
- Interactive maps created with Folium showcasing environmental ratings.

*If applicable, provide links to any live visualizations or embed images directly in the README.*
