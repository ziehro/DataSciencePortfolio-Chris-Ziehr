# Beach Data Analysis

This repository contains two main projects focusing on coastal environmental data analysis. The first is a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook analyzing coastal hazards, and the second is a Python application that creates interactive geo-maps with Folium to visualize beach data based on various metrics.

## Projects

### Coastal Hazard Assessment

The Coastal Hazard Assessment project is a Jupyter Notebook that provides detailed analysis and visualizations of coastal hazard metrics. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and extensive visual analysis to understand the relationships between different environmental factors affecting coastal areas.

#### Highlights:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Feature engineering to create meaningful metrics for analysis.
- Scatter plots and regression analysis between different coastal metrics.
- Conclusions and recommendations based on the data analysis.

To view the notebook, navigate to the `Coastal_Hazard_Assessment` folder and open the `Coastal_Hazard_Assessment.ipynb` file.

### BeachBookMap - Interactive Geo Maps

The BeachBookMap project utilizes Folium to create interactive geo-maps that display various beach metrics. Users can interact with the map to select different layers and visualize the beaches with the highest values for selected metrics.

#### Features:
- Interactive Folium map with layer control.
- Visualization of beaches based on selected environmental metrics.
- Customizable views for different data analysis needs.

To run the BeachBookMap application, execute the `BeachBookMap.py` Python script.

## Installation

To set up the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, folium, etc.).
3. For the Coastal Hazard Assessment, open the Jupyter Notebook in an environment that supports IPython (such as Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code).
4. For the BeachBookMap project, run the `BeachBookMap.py` script in your Python environment.

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the individual project folders and their respective README files.
