# EMF Signal Visualization and Analysis

This directory encompasses the complete process of collecting, visualizing, and analyzing electromagnetic field (EMF) signals from mycelium using a Raspberry Pi and various AI techniques.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore the possibility that mycelium can produce EMF signals that could be interpreted as "words" or communication patterns. By using sophisticated data collection and analysis methods, we aim to decode these signals and contribute to the understanding of plant communication.

## Process Overview

### Hardware Setup

1. **Raspberry Pi Configuration**: Assemble the Raspberry Pi with the Hall effect sensor to detect EMF signals. Ensure proper connections with the ADC for accurate signal measurement.
