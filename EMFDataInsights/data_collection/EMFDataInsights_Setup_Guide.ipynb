    "# EMFDataInsights Project Setup Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the hardware and software components for the EMFDataInsights project. The project involves measuring electromagnetic fields (EMF) using a Hall effect sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi via an ADS1115 ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter). The measured values are then used to control the color of an LED strip, reflecting the EMF intensity in real-time. Additionally, the data is sent to Firebase for real-time web visualization and further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components Required:\n",
    "1. Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)\n",
    "2. ADS1115 ADC module\n",
    "3. Hall effect sensor\n",
    "4. LED strip (compatible with Raspberry Pi)\n",
    "5. Jumper wires\n",
    "6. Breadboard (optional, for easier connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connections:\n",
    "- **Raspberry Pi to ADS1115**:\n",
    "  - Connect Raspberry Pi 3.3V to ADS1115 VDD.\n",
    "  - Connect Raspberry Pi GND to ADS1115 GND.\n",
    "  - Connect Raspberry Pi SCL to ADS1115 SCL.\n",
    "  - Connect Raspberry Pi SDA to ADS1115 SDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ADS1115 to Hall Effect Sensor**:\n",
    "  - Connect ADS1115 VDD to Hall sensor VCC.\n",
    "  - Connect ADS1115 GND to Hall sensor GND.\n",
    "  - Connect ADS1115 A0 to Hall sensor Signal output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Raspberry Pi to LED Strip**:\n",
    "  - Connect Raspberry Pi GND to LED Strip GND.\n",
    "  - Connect a specific GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 10) to the LED Strip data input (refer to your LED strip documentation for the correct pin).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure all connections are secure and correct before powering up your Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up your Raspberry Pi with the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS and connect it to your network.\n",
    "2. Install necessary libraries and tools:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo apt-get update\n",
    "   sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n",
    "   pip3 install firebase-admin adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15 rpi_ws281x\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Clone the project repository:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/<ziehro>/DataSciencePortfolio-Chris-Ziehr/EMFDataInsights.git\n",
    "   cd EMFDataInsights\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Set up Firebase:\n",
    "   - Go to the Firebase console and create a new project.\n",
    "   - Add a new application to your project and download the `firebase-sdk.json`.\n",
    "   - Place the `firebase-sdk.json` file in your project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run the script:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python3 your_script.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `your_script.py` with the name of the main Python script for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the hardware setup and software installation, run the main script to start collecting and visualizing EMF data. Monitor the LED strip's color changes and check the real-time data visualization on your Firebase-hosted website.\n",
    ## Live Graphs

### Real-time Data Visualization
You can view live graphs of the EMF data on the project website. Visit [My Live Graphs](https://yourwebsite.com/live-graphs) to access the real-time visualizations.

## Recorded Event Graphs

### Event-based Data Visualization
Recorded event graphs capture specific events or actions performed on the plant or around the plant. These graphs provide insights into the plant's response to stimuli.

## AI Pattern Detection

### Machine Learning for Pattern Detection
We use machine learning algorithms to analyze the EMF data and detect patterns. This section outlines the AI models used and the insights gained from pattern detection.


    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure all connections are correct and secure.\n",
    "- Check that all required Python libraries are installed.\n",
    "- Validate Firebase credentials and database rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further assistance, refer to the project's README or submit an issue on GitHub.\n"
